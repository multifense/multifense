multifense
==========

Multifense (aka MPTD (Multi Player/Platform Tower Defense) is a mobile game with androd, iOS and Windows clients and a Windows server.

It is the result of a 2 month (roughly) software project at KTH (Kungliga Tekniska HÃ¶gskolan) in Stockholm, Sweden. 

A lot of improvements were planned but the team is too busy with school right now, so we decided to open source the whole thing in the hopes that someone will give it some love.
